# web-scrape-challenge

## Background

This project involves a comprehensive web-scraping and data analysis challenge designed to enhance skills in collecting, organizing, storing, analyzing, and visually communicating data. Using Python, Splinter for automated browsing, and Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing, this project extracts data from Mars-related news and weather reports.

## Project Deliverables

### Deliverable 1: Mars News Article Scraping
- **Objective**: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
- **Methods Used**: Automated browsing with Splinter; data extraction with Beautiful Soup.
- **Results**: Titles and previews are stored in Python dictionaries within a list, and optionally saved to a JSON file for ease of sharing.

### Deliverable 2: Mars Weather Data Analysis
- **Objective**: Scrape and analyze weather data from Mars, specifically from the Curiosity rover.
- **Data Source**: [Mars Temperature Data Site](static website for practice web scraping bot)
- **Analysis Goals**:
  - Determine the number of Martian months and sols (Martian days) from the dataset.
  - Identify the coldest and warmest months on Mars.
  - Find out which months have the highest and lowest atmospheric pressures.
  - Estimate the number of Earth days in one Martian year through data visualization.

  ## Requirements
- **Tools and Libraries**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Splinter, Beautiful Soup.
- **Skills**: HTML element identification, web scraping, data organization, data analysis, and data visualization.

- **Results**: Insights are supported by data visualizations, including bar charts of temperatures and atmospheric pressures. The final dataset is exported to a CSV file.
